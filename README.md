# GraduateAdmissionPrediction
This project aims to evaluate several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. When we went through the process of preparing, applying, and collecting required documents for the admission, we were less informed about how and in what percentage the individual documents will contribute to our selection. Here in this study, we will try to find interesting pattern on how different features relate to chances of admit. The results will surely reveal something insightful. In addition, we have emphasized on making this report comprehensible for non-statistical/technical audiences so the results can then be used by the potential students in strengthening their profile accordingly.
